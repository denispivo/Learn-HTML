## All upcoming tags are tested in the test.html file

## Elements

- `<html>` -> Defines the root of an HTML document
- `<body>` -> Defines the document's body
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` -> Defines HTML headings

## Attributes

- All HTML elements can have **attributes**
- The `href` attribute of `<a>` specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
- The `src` attribute of `<img>` specifies the path to the image to be displayed
- The `width` and height attributes of `<img>` provide size information for images
- The `alt` attribute of `<img>` provides an alternate text for an image
- The `style` attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
- The `lang` attribute of the `<html>` tag declares the language of the Web page
- The `title` attribute defines some extra information about an element

## Paragraphs

- `<p>` -> Defines a paragraph
- `<hr>` -> Defines a thematic change in the content
- `<br>` -> Inserts a single line break
- `<pre>` -> Denies a pre-formatted text

## Styles

- Use the `style` attribute for styling HTML elements
- Use `background-color` for background color
- Use `color` for text colors
- Use `font-family` for text fonts
- Use `font-size` for text sizes
- Use `text-align` for text alignment

## Formatting

- `<b>` 
    <br>-> Defines bold text
    <br>-> without any extra importance
- `<strong>` 
    -> Defines important text
    -> content is typically in bold
- `<i>` -> Defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood, content inside is typically displayed in italic
    <br>=> Tip: The `<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
- `<em>` -> Defines emphasized text, content inside is typically displayed in italic
    <br>=> Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in `<em>` with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
- `<small>` -> Defines smaller text
